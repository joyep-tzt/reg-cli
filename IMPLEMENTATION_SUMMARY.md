# Implementation Summary: Diff Percentage Feature

## Overview
Successfully implemented the requested feature to add percentage of difference to JSON and HTML reports in reg-cli.

## What Was Changed

### Modified Files (Core Changes Only)
1. **src/diff.js** - 8 lines changed
   - Added fields to `DiffResult` type: `width`, `height`, `diffCount`, `diffPercentage`
   - Calculate percentage: `(diffCount / totalPixels) * 100`
   - Send complete diff data to parent process

2. **src/index.js** - 27 lines changed
   - Updated `CompareResult` type with new fields
   - Modified `aggregate()` to preserve diff details
   - Create `diffDetails` object mapping image names to their metrics
   - Pass `diffDetails` to report generation

3. **src/report.js** - 19 lines changed
   - Added `diffDetails` to `ReportParams` type
   - Modified `createJSONReport()` to include `diffDetails` (when not empty)
   - Modified `createHTMLReport()` to add `diffPercentage` to failed items

4. **test/cli.test.mjs** - 30 lines changed
   - Fixed `replaceReportPath()` to handle objects
   - Added assertions to verify `diffDetails` in failing tests
   - Removed `.only` from test case

## Output Examples

### Before (No Percentage)
```json
{
  "failedItems": ["sample.png"],
  "diffItems": ["sample.png"]
}
```

### After (With Percentage)
```json
{
  "failedItems": ["sample.png"],
  "diffItems": ["sample.png"],
  "diffDetails": {
    "sample.png": {
      "width": 800,
      "height": 578,
      "diffCount": 4969,
      "diffPercentage": 1.0746107266435985
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Metrics**
   - Image dimensions (width × height)
   - Exact pixel difference count
   - Percentage difference (0-100 scale)

2. **Backward Compatible**
   - `diffDetails` only added when there are failures
   - Empty object not included
   - Existing tools continue to work

3. **Available in Both Reports**
   - JSON report: `diffDetails` object
   - HTML report: `diffPercentage` in failed item data

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ 24/25 tests passing
- ✅ All new functionality tested
- ✅ Backward compatibility verified
- ⚠️ 1 pre-existing test failure (unrelated perf test)

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test with different images
$ reg-cli ./sample/actual ./sample/expected ./sample/diff -J report.json
✘ 1 file(s) changed.

# Result: diffDetails shows 1.07% difference

# Test with identical images  
$ reg-cli ./sample/expected ./sample/expected ./sample/diff -J report.json
✔ 1 file(s) passed.

# Result: No diffDetails (clean output)
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Insights** - Users can now see exact percentage of image differences
2. **Threshold Analysis** - Can make informed decisions about acceptable differences
3. **Automation** - Can programmatically parse and use percentage data
4. **Debugging** - Understand severity of visual regressions

## Usage

The feature works automatically with existing commands:

```bash
# JSON report will include diffDetails for any failures
reg-cli ./actual ./expected ./diff -J ./report.json

# HTML report will include percentage data
reg-cli ./actual ./expected ./diff -R ./report.html

# Both reports
reg-cli ./actual ./expected ./diff -J ./report.json -R ./report.html
```

## Technical Details

- **Calculation**: `diffPercentage = (diffCount / (width × height)) × 100`
- **Type Safety**: All Flow types updated
- **Performance**: No significant overhead (same diff calculation, just returning more data)
- **Memory**: Minimal impact (only stores data for failed items)

## Files Modified Summary
- **Core Logic**: 3 files (diff.js, index.js, report.js) - 54 lines total
- **Tests**: 1 file (cli.test.mjs) - 30 lines
- **Documentation**: 2 files (FEATURE_SUMMARY.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)

## Conclusion

The implementation is **minimal, focused, and backward compatible**. It provides valuable new information without breaking existing functionality or significantly changing the codebase structure.
